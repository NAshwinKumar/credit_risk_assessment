# Hybrid system with genetic algorithm and artificial neural networks
The hybrid system with genetic algorithm and neural networks(HGA-NN) has been used to identify an optimum feature subset and to increase the classification accuracy and scalability in credit risk assessment.

## Dataset
The performances of the HGA-NN classifier are evaluated using **German credit dataset** which is available in UCI repository

## Reference
This work is an implementation of the below paper<br>[Oreski, S., & Oreski, "G. Genetic algorithm-based heuristic for feature selection in credit risk assessment". Expert Systems with Applications (2013)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2013.09.004)
