# Hybrid system with genetic algorithm and artificial neural networks and its application to retail credit risk assessment
The hybrid genetic algorithm with neural networks (HGA-NN) is used to identify an optimum feature subset and to increase the classification accuracy and scalability in credit risk assessment.

##Dataset
The performances of the HGA-NN classifier are evaluated using **German credit dataset** which is available in UCI repository

##Reference
This work is an implementation of the below paper
